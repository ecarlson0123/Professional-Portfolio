# Challenge 2: Professional Portfolio

## Summary of Project
The goal of this project was to create a professional portfolio that matched the given mock-up as closely as possible.
This mock-up had a header, hero, and three body sections which were:
About me: 
    For this section we needed a pictue of us (the creator of the page) and a breif description.

My work:
    This contains pictures and titles of five works we have created, with our first deployment being larger than the others.
    Due to the fact that we have only created one website, this is the only picture/element in this section with a working link.

Contact me:
    This section has working links to Github and LinkedIn, along with an email ( when clicked opens default mail app) and phone number.

### Step One: Wireframing
First I created the wireframe to give me an idea of the general elements that would be needed to get the page to look as desired.

My wireframing can be seen here: [Wireframing prior to creating any files](./assets/images/wireframing.PNG)


### Step Two: General file and HTML structure
Next the general elements were added to the HTML file, without classes, IDs, or styling of any kind. 
One thing I made sure to add in this step was semantic HTML elements.

### Step Four: Adding starting classes, ID's, and variables
Here I added classes and ID's to all major elements and created classes that can be used anywhere on the page.
These classes, border-right for example, allows for styling of elements to be changed easily without having to edit the enitre CSS or HTML file.

### Step Five: Adding style
This began the implementation of the CSS file. The website was beginning to take shape and elements were beginning to be recognizable.
Step Five took the longest as there were a lot of tweaks that needed to be made along the way in order to get the desired look.

### Step Six: Flexbox
Flexboxes were a major portion of the layout of the website, so this portion took a while because issues like children growing outside the parent flexbox became of concern.
I ended up fixing these issues using the min-width function.

### Step Seven: Screen size compatability
Now to add tweaks to each section so that as the screen size changes, the page continues to look as though it were designed for each screen size.
